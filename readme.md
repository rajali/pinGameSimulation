Score rules
        1. Basic scoring (no strike or spare):
            -   just add the attempts pin number

        2. Strike (first attempt, all ten pins)
            - A strike in tenth frame gives the bowler two extra ball roll attempts
            - place X in the current frame
            - roll next two balls
            - current frame score = score previous frames + 10 (for the strike) + sum of next two attempts

        3. Spare (second attempt, all ten pins)
            - A spare in the tenth frame gives the bowler one extra ball roll.
            - Mark a '/' for the frame
            - Score is knocked 10 pins
            - Plus add what get knocked on the next ball roll

            - current frame score = previous frame score + ten from current frame + next ball attempt score

        5.  If a bowler should get a strike or a spare in the 10th frame,
            the bowlers scoring continues as the bowler throws their bonus shots.

        6.  The bowler who throws a strike in the tenth frame must roll two additional balls to complete the
            score for the tenth frame.

        7.  The bowler who throws a spare in the tenth frame must roll one additional ball to complete the
            score for the tenth frame.

        8.  A perfect game with score "300" pins, you roll ten strikes, once for each frame,
            and then two bonus shots at the end are also strikes.
